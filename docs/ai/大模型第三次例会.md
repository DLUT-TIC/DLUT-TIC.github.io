## Preparation


```python
#!pip install openai
#!pip install retry
#!pip install panel
```

**上节课的moonshot API**

有需要的配置一下jupyter的文件夹

## Review and helper function


```python
from openai import OpenAI
 
client = OpenAI(
    api_key = 'your_API_key',
    base_url = 'https://api.moonshot.cn/v1'
)
 
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model = "moonshot-v1-8k",
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "你是 Kimi，由 Moonshot AI 提供的人工智能助手，你更擅长中文和英文的对话。你会为用户提供安全，有帮助，准确的回答。同时，你会拒绝一切涉及恐怖主义，种族歧视，黄色暴力等问题的回答。Moonshot AI 为专有名词，不可翻译成其他语言。"},

## Guidelines

### Principle 1 clear and specific

#### Tactic 1: Use delimeter


```python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \
providing instructions that are as clear and \
specific as you can possibly make them. \
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \
and context for the model, which can lead to \
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks\
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
```


```python
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

    Provide clear and specific instructions to guide the model towards the desired output, as longer prompts can offer more clarity and context, leading to more detailed and relevant responses.
    

##### 不妨一试


```python

#### Tactic 2: instrcut the model to work out its own solution


```python
prompt = f"""
Determine if the student's solution is correct or not. 

Question:
I'm building a solar power installation and I need \
 help working out the financials. 
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \
me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \
foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations 
as a function of the number of square feet.

Student's Solution:
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 10x = 370x + 100,000
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

    The student's solution is correct. Let's analyze it step by step:
    
    1. **Land cost**: The cost of land is given as $100 per square foot. If the installation is x square feet, then the total land cost is 100 * x, which is represented as 100x.
    
    2. **Solar panel cost**: The cost of solar panels is given as $250 per square foot. For x square feet, the total cost for solar panels is 250 * x, which is represented as 250x.
    
    3. **Maintenance cost**: The maintenance contract has two components:
       - A flat fee of $100,000 per year.
       - An additional cost of $10 per square foot per year. For x square feet, this additional cost is 10 * x, which is represented as 10x.
    
    The total maintenance cost is the sum of the flat fee and the additional cost per square foot, which is 100,000 + 10x.
    
    4. **Total cost for the first year**: The student adds up all the costs to find the total cost for the first year of operations:
       - Land cost: 100x
       - Solar panel cost: 250x
       - Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 10x
    
    The total cost is then the sum of these three components:
       - 100x (land cost)
       - 250x (solar panel cost)
       - 100,000 (flat maintenance fee)
       - 10x (additional maintenance cost per square foot)
    
    When combined, the total cost is:
       - 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 10x
    
    Simplifying the expression by combining like terms (100x + 250x + 10x), we get:
       - 360x + 100,000
    
    However, the student made a small arithmetic error in the final step. The correct total cost should be 360x + 100,000, not 370x + 100,000 as stated in the student's solution.
    
    So, the correct total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet is:
       - Total cost = 360x + 100,000
    
    The student's solution is almost correct, but there is a mistake in the arithmetic when adding the costs of the land and solar panels. The correct total should be 360x, not 370x.

Your task is to determine if the student's solution \

Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

    1. First, we need to calculate the cost of the land. The cost is $100 per square foot, so for x square feet, the cost is 100x.
    
    2. Next, we calculate the cost of the solar panels. The cost is $250 per square foot, so for x square feet, the cost is 250x.
    
    3. Then, we calculate the maintenance cost. The contract states a flat fee of $100k per year plus an additional $10 per square foot. So, the maintenance cost is 100,000 + 10x.
    
    4. To find the total cost for the first year of operations, we add up all the costs: land cost, solar panel cost, and maintenance cost.
    
    Total cost = Land cost + Solar panel cost + Maintenance cost
    Total cost = 100x + 250x + (100,000 + 10x)
    
    5. Simplify the expression:
    Total cost = 360x + 100,000
    
    Comparing this with the student's solution, we see that the student's solution is incorrect. The student's solution incorrectly adds an extra 10x to the maintenance cost, which should not be there.

虽然结果正确了，但是实际上大模型输出并不是按照给定的模板
不见得这样的prompt是有效的，可能单一的分隔符```多次使用会不太清晰
主要是，要求先自己得出解决方案之后再给出是否正确解决了一开始直接回答的问题
需要注意的是，给大模型思考时间和步骤得出的答案虽然比较对，但这不意味着**大模型真的进行了思考，不见得是前面的步骤本身使他生效**

## Iterative 
重点在于，难以一次就能得到好的结果，需要根据模型的输出不断对prompt进行调整

```

    The sentiment of the given product review is mixed, as it contains both positive and negative emotions. The review is written in Chinese and can be translated as follows:
    
    - "哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈" (multiple "hahaha"): This part of the text represents laughter or amusement, which is a positive sentiment.
    - "我好伤心我好悲伤" (I am so sad, I am so sorrowful): This part of the text expresses sadness and sorrow, which is a negative sentiment.
    - "哈哈哈哈哈哈哈" (multiple "hahaha"): Again, this part of the text represents laughter or amusement, which is a positive sentiment.
    
    The review starts and ends with laughter, but it also includes a statement of sadness in the middle. It is difficult to determine the exact sentiment without more context, as the laughter could be genuine or sarcastic. However, based on the text provided, the sentiment can be considered mixed, as it contains both positive and negative emotions.
    


```python

answer in a single word, either "positive" or "negative"

Review text: '''{shenjing_review}'''
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

    negative
    
    The sentiment of the review is negative because the text contains phrases like "我好伤心" (I am very sad) and "我好悲伤" (I am very sorrowful), which express negative emotions. The laughter (哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈) might seem positive, but in this context, it could be interpreted as a sarcastic or ironic expression of the reviewer's actual negative feelings.

In a recent survey conducted by the government,

stating, "I'm not surprised that NASA came out on top. 
It's a great place to work with amazing people and 
incredible opportunities. I'm proud to be a part of 
such an innovative organization."

The results were also welcomed by NASA's management team,

hear that our employees are satisfied with their work at NASA. 
We have a talented and dedicated team who work tirelessly 
to achieve our goals, and it's fantastic to see that their

The survey also revealed that the

response = get_completion(prompt)

```

    This sentence is in French. The sentence "Combien coûte le lampadaire?" translates to "How much does the streetlight cost?" in English. Here's the step-by-step justification for identifying the language:
    
    1. The sentence structure and word order resemble the French language.
    2. The words "Combien" (how much), "coûte" (costs), and "le" (the) are common French words.
    3. The use of the accent in "coûte" is also a characteristic of the French language.
    
    Based on these observations, I can confidently say that the sentence is in French.

So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.
